        <h2><i>Q)</i> What is Leet Code Premium ?</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><i><b>Ans) </b></i>Most of LeetCode’s content is free, but LeetCode Premium enhances all of its positives by granting you access to things like access to premium problems and solutions, access to a built-in debugger, an autocomplete function, and interview simulations with feedback. It also makes it even more effective if you’re using it to prepare for technical interviews, as it grants you access to company-specific programming questions that you can use to have a better grasp of what you can expect from the questions you'll face in interviews with companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, making it the ideal online judge to use if your sights are set on one of these FAANG companies.</p>
